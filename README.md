# Demo
# Crafting-system
This repository contains the code I made for Crafting-system using Unreal Engine 5.
# Algorithms and Data Structures
1. Map: to find the crafting recipe for all items.
2. Set: to save recipes for all items (Each item has its own recipe)
3. Regex: to get number when the user enters input (even if they mistyped the syntax)
# Automatic processing
1. Self-updating item recipes by handling text (provided that the text is written in the syntax of % mark for quantity, // mark for separator between items)
2. If the software checks that modified-table has changed, it automatically updates the data table based on the modified-table check result.
